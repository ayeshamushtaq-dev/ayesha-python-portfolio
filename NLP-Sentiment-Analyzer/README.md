# NLP Sentiment Analyzer

- Uses TF-IDF and logistic regression for binary sentiment classification.
- Tools: Scikit-learn, NLTK

I developed a sentiment analysis project for binary classification of text dataâ€”specifically, determining whether a piece of text is positive or negative. I used Python in Jupyter Notebook along with libraries like NLTK for preprocessing and scikit-learn for modeling.

The process included cleaning the text, removing stopwords, tokenization, and converting the text into numerical features using TF-IDF. I trained a Logistic Regression model and evaluated it using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The model achieved around 85% accuracy on the test set.

This project helped me understand the end-to-end pipeline of NLP classification and also how feature extraction using TF-IDF plays a role in model performance.
